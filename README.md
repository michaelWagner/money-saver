# Money-Saver App

## Overview
The Money-Saver App is a fun and engaging tool designed to help users save money by gamifying the process. Users drag and drop items they could spend money on into a "bucket," representing their decision to save rather than spend. As the bucket fills, so do the user's savings, with visual feedback and rewards that make the experience enjoyable and motivating.
